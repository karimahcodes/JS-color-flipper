# JS-color-flipper Tutorial

This was a code-along project to generate random color values, and assign them to the body of a page.
Explanatory comments are included within the code.

### Skills Tested
- The project incorporates the Math.floor() and Math.random() methods to generate random integer values that will be corresponded with a desired index in an array
- for loops are used to iterate through an array of color variables as well as an array of random alphanumerical values, in order to generate a unique 6-digit hexcode each time the button is clicked.
